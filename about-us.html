    <h3>Advice for password security</h3><br>
A strong password helps you to shield your personal information yet as your identity and money. There are some ways a password is compromised, as an example web server hacks, brute force attacks, rainbow table cracking or social manipulation.<br>


Your password should contain a minimum of 10 characters and include a mixture of minuscule letters, upper-case letter letters, digits and special characters.<br>
Use a password manager tool (for example LastPass, 1password or Dashlane) to manage and store all of your random passwords organized, encrypted and convenient. this manner you merely must remember your master password - ensure you store this in your head.<br><br>
Never re-use a password! Use a singular password for every of your accounts. If one among your accounts gets compromised, the hacker cannot gain access to your other accounts, which greatly limits the damage.
Never send passwords to anyone via email or online messenger services.<br>
Do not use passwords that are easy to guess, as an example ”password123” or ”admin”.
Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all services where it's possible. Using sign, app, bank-ID or finger print as a second factor adds a further layer of security. whether or not someone knows the password it’s simply not enough to log in.<br>
Make sure that your security questions (if you've got lost your password) are extremely difficult to guess.
Do not use your passwords to login to your accounts on other peoples devices, unless you actually trust them and know that they need a standard sense regarding security.<br>
Never store your passwords in an exceedingly plain text document, not even on your local device.
If you’re employing a password generator (such as this one) to form your passwords, confirm that the server is using SSL (https) which the generated passwords aren’t stored on the server.<br>
Never use family names or pets, words from dictionaries or personal references as passwords. Also avoid year of birth, post-code, house-numbers etc. These are easy to brute force or determine.<br>
Be careful of who your trust. Avoid phishing tactics where cybercriminals try and cause you to enter your password on phony websites. Always keep an eye fixed on the address bar in your browser.
Do not share your personal passwords with anyone, not even relations or close friends.<br><br>
<h3>Common advice regarding security</h3><br>
Bookmark your most important websites and access them from there. If you create a typo you'll land on the same phishing-site aimed to steal your information.<br><br>
If employing a mobile device, ensure that you simply have set it up so you'll remotely delete all data thereon it gets lost.<br><br>
Immediately lock your device while leaving it, whether or not you’re away for a brief period of your time.
Do not install any software that you just don't trust 100%. the identical goes for clicking on email attachments, which may trigger vulnerabilities silently within the background.
Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for further improved security and privacy. A VPN encrypts all the info sent and received by a tool connected to the web.<br><br>
While traveling, if you actually have to connect with a public Wi-Fi spot, ensure that you simply use a VPN.<br><br>
<h3>Encrypt your computers Winchester drive.</h3><br> These are core features on both Windows and OS X without additional software. This makes sure nobody are going to be ready to access your information, whether or not they steal your computer and put the Winchester drive into another machine.<br><br>
<h3>Log into your computer as a User rather than Administrator.</h3> <br>
this manner you limit websites and software to change your security settings, execute malicious code or access system files.
Do not log into unencrypted web services. as an example, ensure that a web site is using https and NOT http within the address bar.<br><br>
<h3>Protect your computer with a firewall.</h3><br>
Keep your software package and antivirus software up-to-date to stay yourself protected against trojans, key loggers etc.<br><br>
Be careful of the sites you visit. Shady sites and advertisements can profit of application vulnerabilities and compromise your computer, which may give cybercriminals access to your system and your passwords.<br><br>
<h3>Back-up plan</h3><br>
Make sure that you simply have a recovery plan just in case you have got lost or forgotten your passwords. Backup your encrypted passwords regularly on different trusted locations, so you don’t rely on one single device if disaster strikes.<br><br>

A secondary email address or an extra signaling to someone you actually trust for multi-factor authentication may also be a life saver.
